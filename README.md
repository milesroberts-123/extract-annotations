# extract-annotations
Use Biopython to extract functional gene annotations from a GFF file and output them as a tab-delimited text file.

In some bioinformatic analyses, it can be helpful to create a list of all the functional annotations (i.e. short statements on the function of potential gene products), often as an intermediary step to adding such annotations to a fasta file. 

## USAGE

The syntax for this script is as follows:

`python3 extract_annotations.py <GFF FILE> <NAME YOU WANT FOR OUTPUT FILE>`

For example, this code:

`python3 extract_annotations.py my_example_genes.gff my_example_annotations.txt`

will extract the annotations in my_example_genes.gff and save the results to the my_example_annotations.txt file. The first column in the text file will be the mRNA feature id associated with each annotation and the second column will be the actual functional annotation.

## FORMAT NOTES

The functional annoations are assumed to be in the dictionary entry "Note" under the mRNA features. Like in the my_example_genes.gff file.

## DEPENDENCIES

1. Biopython. Install with:

`pip install biopython`

If that doesn't work, see [here](https://biopython.org/wiki/Download).

2. The GFF file parser for Biopython. Install with:

`pip install bcbio-gff`

3. Python3 - I tested this script with Python v3.8.2

## REFERENCES

I acquired the example gff file from the [Sol Genomics Network](https://solgenomics.net/organism/Solanum_lycopersicum/genome).
